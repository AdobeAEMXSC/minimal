# Enabled virtual hosts will be symlinked here. Their names should match the pattern '*.vhost'
#

# instead of a symlink to `../available_vhosts/default.vhost`, this is a copy of `../available_vhosts/default.vhost`
# this is done to avoid developers working on windows commiting Linux incompatible symlink
